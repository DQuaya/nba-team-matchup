# NBA Matchup Predictor
Matchup is a front-end web application created with the goal of helping basketball enthusiast. This front-end client is built with [React](https://react.dev/) functional components, styled with vanilla CSS.

## Description

Matchup was developed for basketball enthusiast who ever had a debate about which team would beat which team or how legend teams would hold up against current teams.  

Once on site account, the player list is available to be viewed via carousel. User can click either the right or left arrow to scroll through players.

Users can select 10 players, 5 for Team A and 5 for Team B. Once players are selected, user can click button
to have the computer calculate and determined which team would win based on players selected stats.

an NBA team

>Future Feature: I will fetch the players from an API so that every NBA player is listed
